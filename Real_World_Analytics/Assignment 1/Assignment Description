The Dataset for this assignment is a modified version of a subset of data used in Candanedo et al, 2017.
The experimental data have been used to create models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house.
The modified Dataset provides the energy use of Appliances (denoted as Y) using 671 samples.
The Dataset comprises 5 features (variables), which are denoted as X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5.
The details about these variables are given below:

X1: Temperature in kitchen area, in Celsius
X2: Humidity in kitchen area, given as a percentage
X3: Temperature outside (from weather station), in Celsius
X4: Humidity outside (from weather station), given as a percentage
X5: Visibility (from weather station), in km
Y: Appliances, energy use, in Wh
For more information about the variables see Candanedo et al, 2017.
